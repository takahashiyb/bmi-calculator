## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this body mass index calculator page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their weight classification to the sentence "Your BMI suggests you’re" within the results component.

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI 30 or greater

Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that it is better sometimes to work on smaller sections of the webpage first, then lay it out after as a whole. Also tried to change a lot of element's attributes using JS to properly set up for accessibility. Although the accessibility part still needs more improvement, I am glad that I got to work on my JS skills.

### Continued development

Learning about how to set up the accessibility is a work in progress, although, I got the gist of the topic, in testing, there will always be mistakes. I also need to learn to plan out the tasks as well as the design. Although I did it for this task, there were a lot of parts that I have overlooked which lead to more time wasted on reframing things that I have already done.
